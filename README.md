# Predicting Credit Card Account Cancellations

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit card account cancellations using machine learning. The dataset contains information on over 4,000 customers of a U.S. bank, including various financial and demographic attributes. The objective is to analyze the factors leading to cancellations and develop predictive models to assess customer retention risks.

## Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns in customer behaviors.
- Analyze **key factors** influencing account cancellations.
- Develop **machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of cancellations.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes fields such as **account balance, credit score, transaction history, customer demographics, and cancellation status**.
- Missing values and outliers are handled in the preprocessing phase.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Feature engineering and selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations.
   - Identifying trends affecting account cancellations.
3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Applying machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict cancellations.
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identifying high-risk customer segments.
   - Suggesting targeted retention strategies for at-risk customers.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Machine Learning Models** for predictive analysis

## Results
- Key factors contributing to credit card account cancellations were identified.
- Machine learning models were trained to predict the likelihood of account cancellations.
- Actionable insights and recommendations were provided to enhance customer retention.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating **deep learning models** for better accuracy.
- Developing a **real-time monitoring dashboard** for account cancellations.
- Expanding analysis with **additional customer data** for improved predictions.
